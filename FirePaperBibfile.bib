	abstract = {In recent years, composite sandwich material has been widely used in civil engineering due to its high strength to weight ratio, high stiffness to weight ratio and anti-corrosion ability. However, the existing research studies indicated that interfacial delamination between skins and core was a common failure mode for this kind of material, which seriously threatens the durability and safety of structures. Furthermore, up to now, there are no research studies investigating the effects of elevated temperature on the interfacial fracture and damage behavior of the sandwich material. To address the above questions, this paper investigated the effects of elevated temperature on mode II interfacial fracture response of foam core sandwich materials by adopting the end-notched ﬂexure method. Test results showed that the loads and the strain energy release rate decreased under the same crack length as the temperature increased. In the meantime, the corresponding analytical model, considering the effect of frictional stresses between the crack edges, has been proposed to predict the interfacial strain energy release rate. The comparison of the analytical and experimental results revealed that the analytical model could accurately predict the strain energy release rate of mode II interfacial fracture of foam core sandwich materials at elevated temperatures.},

The present work models the necking localization of a metal sheet during an electromagnetic process and examines the factors that inﬂuence this process. A Marciniak–Kuczynski ‘‘weak band’’ model is used to predict the onset of necking of a thin sheet under plane stress, an idealization of the local conditions in a thin sheet subjected to unconstrained electromagnetic loading. It is found that electromagnetic forming (EMF) increases ductility over quasistatic techniques due to the material’s strain-rate sensitivity, with ductility increasing monotonically with applied strain rates. The electric current also increases onset of necking strains, but the details depend on thermal sensitivity and temperature-dependence of the strain-rate sensitivity exponent. Given the insensitivity of the results to actual strain proﬁles, this local type analysis provides a useful tool that can be used for ductility predictions involving EMF processes.},

	abstract = {Uniaxial compression stress–strain tests were carried out on three commercial amorphous polymers: polycarbonate (PC), polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), and polyamideimide (PAI). The experiments were conducted under a wide range of temperatures (À40 °C to 180 °C) and strain rates (0.0001 sÀ1 up to 5000 sÀ1). A modiﬁed split-Hopkinson pressure bar was used for high strain rate tests. Temperature and strain rate greatly inﬂuence the mechanical response of the three polymers. In particular, the yield stress is found to increase with decreasing temperature and with increasing strain rate. The experimental data for the compressive yield stress were modeled for a wide range of strain rates and temperatures according to a new formulation of the cooperative model based on a strain rate/temperature superposition principle. The modeling results of the cooperative model provide evidence on the secondary transition by linking the yield behavior to the energy associated to the b mechanical loss peak. The eﬀect of hydrostatic pressure is also addressed from a modeling perspective.},

Shear properties are also included. These tests provide sufficient information to allow calibration of a macroscopic, continuum constitutive model. Calibrated foam plasticity parameters are tabulated, and unique feature of foam plasticity are explained. Also, initial development of mesoscale simulations, which explicitly model voids and sintered hollow spheres, is reported.
